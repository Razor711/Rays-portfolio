  <p>Hi my name is Ray and welcome to my Portfolio Site. Here is where I am putting my projects as I learn about Web Devlopment. My goal is to learn the following:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>HTML</li>
    <li>CSS</li>
    <li>JavaScript</li>
    <li>PHP</li>
    <li>MySQL</li>
  </ol> 
  <p>Most of my programming is done with MS Notepad. In the future I will be adding more to the site as I attempt new projects and work on improving the projects that I have completed.</p>
  <p>Stay Safe!</p>
